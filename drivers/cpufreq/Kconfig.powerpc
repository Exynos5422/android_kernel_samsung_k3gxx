config CPU_FREQ_CBE
	tristate "CBE frequency scaling"
	depends on CBE_RAS && PPC_CELL
	default m
	help
	  This adds the cpufreq driver for Cell BE processors.
	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.
	  If you don't have such processor, say N

config CPU_FREQ_CBE_PMI
	bool "CBE frequency scaling using PMI interface"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_CBE
	default n
	help
	  Select this, if you want to use the PMI interface to switch
	  frequencies. Using PMI, the processor will not only be able to run at
	  lower speed, but also at lower core voltage.

config CPU_FREQ_MAPLE
	bool "Support for Maple 970FX Evaluation Board"
	depends on PPC_MAPLE
